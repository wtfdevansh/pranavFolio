        <p className="mb-4">
          Hello! I'm Pranav , Iâ€™m a tech enthusiast with a strong foundation in networking and cybersecurity, skilled in securing systems, analyzing threats, and ensuring safe digital environments.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          My journey in tech started with a simple "Hello, World!" and has since evolved into a deep love for coding and problem-solving. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to learn new skills and take on challenging projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying a good cup of coffee.
